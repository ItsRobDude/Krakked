# Krakked Contract (Phases 1–7)

The consolidated, up-to-date design contract now lives in [`docs/phases/contract.md`](./phases/contract.md).
It is generated directly from the latest phase documents (`phase1.md` through `phase7.md`) stored in the same
folder so the single reference always stays in sync with the individual files.
