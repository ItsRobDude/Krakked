# Replay Experiment Log

This log captures durable conclusions from local offline replay evidence. Saved
JSON reports and ad-hoc probe outputs remain local unless they become part of a
reviewed report fixture.

## 2026-05-25: Starter Strategy Replay Truth Pass

Context:

- Baseline replay window: `2026-05-05T00:00:00+00:00 -> 2026-05-25T00:00:00+00:00`
- Cost model: `50 bps` slippage plus `25 bps` taker fee
- Starter pair/timeframe coverage was complete for the default replay lane.
- The report now distinguishes configured params from constructor defaults and
  engine evaluation timeframes before drawing strategy conclusions.

### `rs_rotation` Cost Sensitivity

`rs_rotation` is not promotion-ready under the current replay cost model. This is
an offline replay finding, not a live trading conclusion.

| Requested window | Current-cost return | Current-cost `rs_rotation` realized PnL | Zero-cost return | Zero-cost `rs_rotation` realized PnL |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `2026-03-21T00:00:00+00:00 -> 2026-04-10T00:00:00+00:00` | `-0.6398%` | `-$62.5823` | `-0.2644%` | `-$29.0903` |
| `2026-04-10T00:00:00+00:00 -> 2026-04-30T00:00:00+00:00` | `-0.2199%` | `-$8.9661` | `0.0802%` | `$17.7816` |
| `2026-04-30T00:00:00+00:00 -> 2026-05-20T00:00:00+00:00` | `-0.4704%` | `-$13.2996` | `-0.2962%` | `$1.9889` |
| `2026-05-05T00:00:00+00:00 -> 2026-05-25T00:00:00+00:00` | `-0.4940%` | `-$27.8754` | `-0.3883%` | `-$18.7442` |

Readout:

- Current-cost replay lost across all four covered windows.
- Zero-cost replay was mixed, which points to cost sensitivity rather than a
  proven directional inversion.
- Keep `rs_rotation` in investigation status until a later slice explains or
  improves its edge after realistic costs.

### `vol_breakout` Threshold Probe

Probe configuration:

- Window: `2026-05-18T12:00:00+00:00 -> 2026-05-25T00:00:00+00:00`
- Starter pairs: `BTC/USD`, `ETH/USD`, `SOL/USD`, `ADA/USD`
- Timeframes swept independently with explicit replay `timeframes=[...]`
- `lookback_bars=20`, `breakout_multiple=1.5`
- `min_compression_bps` swept across `10`, `25`, `50`, `100`, `150`, `250`, `500`

| Timeframe | `min_compression_bps` | Preflight | Intents | Actions | Filled orders |
| --- | ---: | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `15m` | `10` | `ready` | `0` | `0` | `0` |
| `15m` | `25` | `ready` | `0` | `0` | `0` |
| `15m` | `50` | `ready` | `1` | `1` | `1` |
| `15m` | `100` | `ready` | `11` | `11` | `4` |
| `15m` | `150` | `ready` | `22` | `22` | `4` |
| `15m` | `250` | `ready` | `35` | `35` | `5` |
| `15m` | `500` | `ready` | `40` | `40` | `5` |
| `1h` | `10` | `ready` | `0` | `0` | `0` |
| `1h` | `25` | `ready` | `0` | `0` | `0` |
| `1h` | `50` | `ready` | `0` | `0` | `0` |
| `1h` | `100` | `ready` | `0` | `0` | `0` |
| `1h` | `150` | `ready` | `0` | `0` | `0` |
| `1h` | `250` | `ready` | `0` | `0` | `0` |
| `1h` | `500` | `ready` | `3` | `3` | `2` |

Readout:

- The strategy can fire on cached data, so the silence is not a replay wiring
  failure.
- The default `10 bps` compression threshold was too selective for this probe
  window.
- Do not change thresholds from this single short-window probe; use it only to
  justify a later dedicated threshold-validation slice.
